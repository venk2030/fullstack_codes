# ADR 0001: Why GA4 Measurement Protocol

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to track user interaction events server-side. GA4 MP provides a reliable, HTTP-based method to send analytics data without requiring frontend instrumentation.

## Decision

We implemented a `/track/` endpoint that collects analytics data and forwards it to GA4 using Measurement Protocol.

## Consequences

- Avoids client-side GA SDK issues (ad-blockers, privacy settings)
- Easier GDPR compliance via backend filtering
- Requires batching logic for efficiency (handled via Celery)
